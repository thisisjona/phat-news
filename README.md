### This project began with no provided code.  It was bulit from the ground up starting wioth a wireframe model and a collaboration of ideas among team memebers. 

Our job on this project is to create a working reference page for sports news both within the country and around the globe.  Our site will log a user's name and country of origin and save the data for future website visits.  

The user will be presented with a list of countries from which they would like to obtain sports news from around the globe.  Upon choosing a country the user will be presented with several articles from the selection with links to the source.

There will also be an aside of sports news cards from the 4 major sports here in the USA with links to the latest 10 stories from each respective sport.
